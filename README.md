Author: Michael Anderton michael.anderton@grayanalytics.com

This project is for the development of a Cyber Assistance Tool formerly known as IRP Tool.

Thre are currently two enviromnets to use locally Vagrant and Docker and I have included a Vagrantfile and a Dockerfile.

Pipeline intentions
1) Create Docker image in 1/2 phases (dev/test?)
2) Install Vagrant on the Docker image and use vagrant to provision the ubuntu environment
